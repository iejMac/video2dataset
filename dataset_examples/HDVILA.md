# [HDVILA-100M](https://github.com/microsoft/XPretrain/tree/main/hd-vila-100m)
HDVILA 100M is a dataset of 100M high-resolution videos from YouTube.

## Download the metdata
First, run `wget -O hdvila100m.zip https://hdvila.blob.core.windows.net/dataset/hdvila100m.zip?sp=r&st=2022-06-28T03:33:11Z&se=2026-01-01T11:33:11Z&spr=https&sv=2021-06-08&sr=b&sig=VaqQkLFDqKinfkaPNs1jJ1EQIYCB%2FUPYiqFqmjWye6Y%3D` to download the HD VILA 100M metadata. Next, just run `unzip hdvilla100m.zip` in order to unzip the metadata. You should now have an `hdvila100m/` directory.

Next, we need to do some preprocessing to get this metadata formatted into a nice parquet. The following script will take the downloaded metadata `.jsonl` files and create a parquet with all the relevant information.

```python
import pandas as pd
import glob
import json
import os
import time
from datetime import datetime

def time_string_to_seconds(timestamp):
    hh,mm,s = timestamp.split(':')
    ss,ms = s.split('.')
    time = 3600*int(hh) +  60*int(mm) + int(ss) + int(ms)/1000
    return time

def convert_clip_list(clip_list):
    return [[time_string_to_seconds(x) for x in clip] for clip in clip_list]

parquet_dir = "/path/to/my/metadata/dir/"

data = []
for jsonl in sorted(glob.glob(f"{parquet_dir}*.jsonl")):
    path = os.path.join(parquet_dir, jsonl)
    with open(path, "r") as f:
        for line in f:
            json_obj = json.loads(line)
            clips = [
                json_obj['clip'][i]['span']
                for i in range(len(json_obj['clip']))
            ]

            out = {
                'video_id': json_obj['video_id'],
                'url': json_obj['url'],
                'clips': clips
            }
            data.append(out)

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
df['clips'] = df['clips'].map(lambda x: convert_clip_list(x))
df.to_parquet("hd_vila.parquet")
```

Once you run this, you should have a file `hd_vila.parquet` with all the relevant metadata.

## Create the config for Stage 1

Since we download these videos in HD we want to decrease the number of samples per shard (a good heuristic is having shards be ~1Gb). We also wanted to use fewer processes because the many shards being processed at once on a single machine exceeded RAM. Additionally we wanted to use slurm to process this dataset since we set up slurm distribution and it was easier to manage than pyspark. Finally we wanted to detect cuts for each video and place them in the metadata so we need to add a subsampler for that:

```yaml
subsampling:
    CutDetectionSubsampler:
        args:
            cut_detection_mode: "all"
            framerates: null
            threshold: 11.5
            min_scene_len: 15

reading:
    yt_args:
        download_size: 360
        download_audio_rate: 44100
        yt_metadata_args:
            writesubtitles:  True
            subtitleslangs: ['en']
            writeautomaticsub: True
            get_info: True
    timeout: 60
    sampler: null

storage:
    number_sample_per_shard: 100
    captions_are_subtitles: False

distribution:
    processes_count: 32
    thread_count: 32
    subjob_size: 10000
    distributor: "slurm"
    distributor_args:
        partition: "cpu64"
        n_nodes: 16
        account: "laion"
        cache_path: "/fsx/home-iejmac/.slurm_cache"
```

## Stage 1 (Downloading + Cut Detection)

This command runs video2dataset on the input parquet and saves the videos and audio along with the metadata in the webdataset format.

```python
    video2dataset(
        url_list='/fsx/proj-stablediffusion/datasets/hd-vila/hd_vila.parquet',
        input_format='parquet',
        output_format='webdataset',
        output_folder='s3://stability-west/hd-vila/base_dataset',
        url_col="url",
        enable_wandb=True,
        encode_formats={"video": "mp4", "audio": "m4a"},
	config="path/to/config.yaml"
    )
```

## Stage 1 Performance

Over the course of downloading we ran into some bugs (which are now resolved) which required restarts, here's the WandB report for [one of the restarts](https://api.wandb.ai/links/iejmac/nn9hcaol). The downloading was performed on a cluster of 16 c6i cpu64 aws nodes (64 cpu cores) and the total downloading time can be deduced from the videos/s in the report (~28 hours). We were not just downlading the videos but also the audio and the youtube metadata and performing cut detection on the videos which is placed in the metadata of the samples.
