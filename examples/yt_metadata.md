### Download YouTube metadata & subtitles:
#### Usage

In order to extract metadata from youtube videos you must configure your config such that the the `yt_metadata_args` entry is present in the `yt_args` key of the reading specifications as such:


```yaml
yt_args:
    download_size: 360
    download_audio_rate: 44100
    yt_metadata_args:
        writesubtitles:  True
        subtitleslangs: ['en']
        writeautomaticsub: True
        get_info: True
```


#### Output

For every sample the metadata will be present in the json file as such:

```json

And since we specified that captions_are_subtitles the txt file will have the subtitle for that given clip inside of it. For this particular example it would be: "analytics to assess performance based on"
